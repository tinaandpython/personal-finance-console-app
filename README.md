# personal-finance-console-app

Develop a console application to manage personal finances. The application should allow users to input their income and expenses, view their balance, generate reports, and perform operations such as deleting and updating financial records.

Requirements:

Use sqlite database to save data
Create a Finances table:
id - primary key
type - finance type (income/expenses)
amount - amount of money
category - any category (for example: Entertainment, School, Food, etc.)
Create a console menu, where I could choose what I want to do
Available functions:
Enter income: I should be able to enter a sum and category of the income. It should get saved to the database
Enter expenses: I should be able to enter a sum and category of the expense. It should get saved to the database
Get balance: Print out the balance to the terminal (The sum of income minus the sum of expenses)
Get all incomes: Print out the list of all incomes to the terminal (id, type, sum, category)
Get all expenses: Print out the list of all expenses to the terminal (id, type, sum, category)
Delete income/expense: I should be able to select any income/expense and delete it from the database (think about by what value you select the income/expense)
Update income/expense: I should be able to select any income/expense and update its type (expense/income), sum, category. Updates should get saved to the database
